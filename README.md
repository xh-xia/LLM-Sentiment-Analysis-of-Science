Which script does what:</br>

- `generate_data.ipynb` pre-processes; prepare data for figure making; this script is the main script one needs
- `chatgpt_validation.ipynb` regarding inter-annotator agreement and model performance
- `multiple_linear_regression.ipynb` regarding gender moderator effects; the only time where R programming language is used.
- `plot*.ipynb` all `.ipynb` files with a `plot` prefix are figure making scripts; run only after finishing `generate_data.ipynb` entirely
- The rest are all helper scripts
